The very first website - info.cern.ch - was launched in Aug 1991 called the "worldwide web project".

A year later an additional 9 sites joined the world wide web.  By 1994, impressive growth of 2000% saw the rise of Yahoo.  The one million mark was breached in 1996 (Amazon launched in 1995), ten million in 1999 (Google in 1998, Paypal in 1999),  50 million in 2003 (Wordpress and Linkedin), 500 million in 2011 and by now possibly 2 billion websites.  *

This is extremely impressive growth indeed and shows no sign of slowing down.  However, not all these websites are active; most are not.  Some are "parked", with the domain name used entirely for email addresses. Possibly as much as 75% of domain names are actually not active. But the fact that so many have been registered means that the domain name is active and unavailable for others which does lead to the newer problem of naming conventions.
